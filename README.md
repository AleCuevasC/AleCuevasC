### About Me  

I’m a **Data Scientist and Researcher** with international research experience (Japan) specializing in **Machine Learning**, **Predictive Modeling**, and **Data Science Education**.  
My work bridges academia and applied research — exploring how data-driven methods can be used to solve real-world problems in healthcare, education, and technology**.

I have designed and taught data science courses, led multidisciplinary teams, and conduct research on class imbalance, wearable sensor data, and explainable machine learning.  

**Current focus:**  
- Binary classification and synthetic data generation for medical applications 
- Explainable AI & trustworthy ML  
- Data visualization and experimental design in research contexts

Based in Cuernavaca, Mexico | Open to collaborations in AI for health, education, and responsible data science.
